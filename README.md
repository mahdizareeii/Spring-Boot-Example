Hexagonal architecture is a software design approach that organizes an application into concentric layers.
At its core is the business logic, which is surrounded by layers of adapters that interact with external systems such as databases, user interfaces, and external services.
This separation makes it easier to develop and test the core logic independently, promoting flexibility and maintainability.
